# Social media plots generator

**social_media_plots** is a simple repo that contains a bunch of scripts that generate plots based on your csv file with your time spent in different apps.

It's nothing big, I just made it to help me realize how much time I was wasting in this apps and decided to share the scripts.
You can set the target time and see the relationship between the target and the actual median of you wasted time.

### CSV file format example

Date,Reddit,Wapp,Fb,Chrome

10-01-2021,20,19,6,6

11-01-2021,38,79,5,9


Right now, it only supports this apps, but modifying the script should be no challenge. The time is in minutes

### Plots
Some of the plots I generated, you can find more plots in their special folder
